# Memory Game Project for Udacity Nanodegree Program.

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Project Dependencies:

Added external libraries for web designs & development: bootstrap font-awesome, google fonts and jQuery.

## How to Play:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.

### Game Result:

If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

If the player completes the game with the moves less than or equal to 15, he will get rating as 3 stars, if the no.of moves greater than 15 and less than or equal to 25, he will get rating as 2 stars, if the no.of moves greater than 25, he will get rating as 1 star.

The Game result will display the Player's performance rating with the no.of Moves and the time duration has taken to complete the game.
